# mtf-code-refactor

This is a project for the UW Coding Bootcamp for week one. In this project, we are refactoring coding for a fictional website. There are three goals:

* The website should be search engine optimized, which requires including semantic code for sections, asides, etc.
* The website should be accessible, which requires adding image alt text for screen readers.
* The website's code should be comprehensible, which requires sensible CSS code sectioned into logical sections.

To achieve these goals, I assigned descriptive alt text to the site images to increase SEO searchability and optimize for screen reading software. 
I refactored HTML elements into semantic elements, replacing generic 'div' tags with more specific tags.
I defined each element's affects on the site through notes that describe each section.
I made it more legible for other developers by refactoring the website's CSS to account for HTML changes made.
